We expect all of our attendees, sponsors, and volunteers to be respectful and
considerate of others. They are all required to agree with this code of conduct.
Organisers will enforce it throughout the event.

OpenHackSYR is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or profession (or lack of any of the
aforementioned). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate under any circumstances.
Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned, expelled, or permanently
excluded from the event at the discretion of the organisers or host.

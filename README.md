To run locally or contribute, please follow directions from the theme's README:

> A Grunt environment is also included. There are a number of tasks it performs 
like minification of the JavaScript, compiling of the LESS files, adding banners 
to keep the Apache 2.0 license intact, and watching for changes. Run the grunt 
default task by entering `grunt` into your command line which will build the 
files. You can use `grunt watch` if you are working on the JavaScript or the LESS.
>
> You can run `jekyll serve`  and `grunt watch` at the same time to watch for 
changes and then build them all at once.

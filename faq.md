## What is OpenHack?
It is a gathering of like-minded individuals. It’s a place for those of us who 
spend our free time writing code or pushing pixels.

OpenHack Syracuse is our local fork of the 
[OpenHack meetup group](http://openhack.github.io).

## When do we meet?
We typically meet on the second Tuesday of every month. 

(Sign up for our [newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/openhacksyr) to get 
details each month)

Meetings start at 6, and we generally wrap up around 9pm. If there’s interest, 
we will head to a nearby coffee shop or bar for more discussion.

## But, where do we meet?

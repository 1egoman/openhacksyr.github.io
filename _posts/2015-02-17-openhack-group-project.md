We've decided start a *Group Project* as part of our monthly meetup. 

Having a group project provides a common reference for OpenHack members. 
It also offers a place for new members to jump in and contribute.

## The Project 

The project goal is to create *The Ultimate Syracuse Live Music &amp; Art 
Event Calendar*. 

The application will aggregate event data from the social 
accounts and websites of local musicians, venues, and community pages.

With live updating event data, the app will provide multiple ways to view events. 
In essence the app attempts to answer the question: *"What is going on in 
Syracuse?"*

## What We Have So Far

An empty repository on GitHub, [Codename Otto](https://github.com/openhacksyr/otto).

## The Rules

The source code for the entire project will be open source. The code will be on
[GitHub](https://github.com), and anyone can contribute to the project via [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

There is no *right way* to do anything, no one's code is sacred. Remember: 
this is all a fun learning exercise.

Have a suggestion? [Open an issue](https://github.com/openhacksyr/otto/issues) on 
GitHub.

### The Most Important Rule 

Be nice to each other. We are all here to learn something new. 

## The Tech Stack

Initially the app will be written using the 
[Ruby on Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) web framework. 
All code will be managed with git, using 
[GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for feature branches 
and pull requests.

Moving forward, this project should provide a broad range of development options. 
Such as:

- Proper web design! Which will be required at some point
- Solid unit and integration testing 
- Deployment / Devops options (I'd love to see us try out new tech like docker and CoreOS for deployment)
- Converting the app to an API with Javascript / Mobile frontends 


So, that's it. Let's build something great!

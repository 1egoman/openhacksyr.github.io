Welcome to the OpenHack Syracuse meetup group! This is our local "fork" of the
worldwide [OpenHack](http://openhack.github.io) group, whose motto is "Code
together, on anything". 

OpenHack Syracuse was formed in 2014 to build a community in Syracuse for people
who code, design, and build things in their spare time. 

We welcome programmers of all professions, experience levels, and abilities to join us
and become better developers, together. 

We pride ourselves on being a friendly, casual group, and are always happy to
have new faces at meetings. Please check the [FAQ](/faqs.html), and consider
attending our next meetup!

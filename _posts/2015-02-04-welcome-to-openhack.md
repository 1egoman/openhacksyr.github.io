Welcome to the OpenHack Syracuse meetup group! This is our local "fork" of the
worldwide [OpenHack](http://openhack.github.io) meetup, whose motto is "Code
together, on anything". 

OpenHack Syracuse was formed in 2014 to build a community of people in Syracuse
who like to code, design, and build things in their spare time. 

We welcome programmers of all abilities to join us and become better developers,
together. Students, freelancers, professionals, and hobbyists are all welcome to
join.

We pride ourselves on being a friendly, casual group, and are always happy to
see new faces at meetings. Please check out the [FAQ](/faqs.html), and consider
attending our next meetup!
